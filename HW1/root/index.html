			<h3>Global Hunger Index</h3>

				The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger globally and by country and region.
				Calculated each year by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the GHI highlights successes and failures in hunger
				reduction and provides insights into the drivers of hunger. (IFPRI, 2015)

					<h4>Design Choices:</h4>
					<p>The diagram is a line chart.  The scale of the diagram does not work.  It does have good icons. The color selections are ugly.</p>
					<h4>Good Or Bad Explanation:</h4>
					<p>
						This diagram is bad.  It doesn't show conversion rates that scale.  It does not give any indication of the time frame ie. 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, etc.
						It only shows the growth of 1.7 more from one node to the next.
						It also shows retail twice in the header and the sub-header.
					</p>
					<h4>Authors Point Of View:</h4>
					<p>The author is trying to convey the growth of mobile retail conversion rates in 2014. </p>
					<h4>Improvements:</h4>
					<p>
						The diagram needs new colors.
						Along the x-axis on the bottom show the months for year.
						Along the y-axis show the conversion rates.
						The author could have added different color lines for each ways users use to mobile shop. The diagram can also use a ledger for colors/ways to shop.
					</p>

					<h4>Design Choices:</h4>
					<p>
						The type of this diagram is a bar chart.  The colors of this chart blend well together.  They go well together.  Scale is not very clear.  It also is not clear
						what time frame the diagram is for.
					</p>
					<h4>Good Or Bad Explanation:</h4>
					<p>
						This diagram is bad.  It tries to compare too many things in one diagram.  It is comparing multiple car companies with two types of index scores.  The scale is not
						very clear other than you are forced to compare the index score from one triangle to the next.
					</p>
					<h4>Authors Point Of View:</h4>
					<p>
						The author in this diagram is trying to convey the index score for communications systems and assistance systems in cars connected to the internet in 2013.  The index
						score is calculated by efficiency, comfort, environment, and safety.
					</p>
					<h4>Improvements:</h4>
					<p>
						I would turn this into a stacked bar chart.   It would be easier to see that along the y-axis you could have index scores, and along the y-axis have the car companies.  The
						author could then have a legend with two different colors.  One color could indicate the communications systems index score, and the other color could indicate the assistance systems
						index score.  This will give the viewer a easy to see visual.

					<h4>Design Choices:</h4>
					<p>
						The type of diagram is a Alluvial/flow diagram.  Each stacked rectangle pair is represented by their unique color for each week.
						The rectangles in each node represent each team's single game. The rectangle size represents the probability of the team winning.
						When you hover over a team's rectangle it will highlight the details of that game, and it will highlight the path each team is taking
						for each week.
					</p>
					<h4>Good Or Bad Explanation:</h4>
					<p>
						This diagram is good because it is very easy to see what team is playing playing and their opponent for each week.  It also is very interactive,
						and it contains a popover when you do a hover over the rectangles.
					</p>
					<h4>Authors Point Of View:</h4>
					<p>The author wanted to create an easy to view diagram that will allow the viewer to see what teams are playing for each week.  Also the author
					wanted the viewer to see the probability of each team winning or losing.</p>
					<h4>Improvements:</h4>
					<p>I couldn't really find room for improvement on this chart.</p>

					<h4>Design Choices:</h4>
					<p>
						The type of diagram is a timeline diagram.  The colors represent each publication.  The graph scales well for multiple years and sizes.
					</p>
					<h4>Good Or Bad Explanation:</h4>
					<p>
						This diagram is works well because it is easy to view the years/publications.  There is no guessing what the author is trying to show. The growth
						patterns are easily recognizable.
					</p>
					<h4>Authors Point Of View:</h4>
					<p>
						The author is trying to show publication counts over time for different topics in neuroscience and brain stimulation.
					</p>
					<h4>Improvements:</h4>
					<p>The only improvement I would make for this diagram is maybe a hover that would indicate what the circle sizes actually represent.</p>
